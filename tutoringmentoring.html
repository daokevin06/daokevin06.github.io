  <h1>Mentoring</h1>
    <a>I often mentor undergraduates through UW-Madison's Directed Reading Program. 
      If you are an undergraduate interested in representation theory or algebraic geometry, and want to do a directed reading, then feel free to reach out!</a>

  <a> Some past topics of DRPs I have mentored for are the following: Atiyah-Macdonald's Introduction to Commutative Algebra, Miranda's book on Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces, Cox-Little-O'Shea's book on Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms, Stein and Shakarchi's book on Complex Analysis, and Serre's book on the representation theory of finite groups.</a>
  <h1>Tutoring</h1>
    <a>I have experience tutoring students anywhere taking classes anywhere from the middle school level to the upper division pure mathematics level. If you are specifically seeking me out as a tutor, then feel free to reach out and we might be able to work something out!</a>
